The index page contains a list of card groups. Clicking on any one of them will open up a random card from the group. Click the card once to get the meaning, click it second time, and move onto the next card. \r\n\r\nAt the bottom of each card you will find some basics stats and a Home button, which will allow you to select a different group.\r\n\r\nTODOs include numerous cleanup items to make the code less cluttered and tested.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
